# 👋 **Welcome to the AgentCraft — AI Agent Development Handbook** 
***Your all-in-one guide to building intelligent AI agents from scratch.***
***This website for testing the github action***

Whether you're a curious beginner or a builder looking to scale your next project, this handbook will walk you through everything step by step — from core concepts and architecture to tools, frameworks, and real-world examples.

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to create AI agents that can read, plan, act, and even collaborate with other agents or tools. Let’s get building!

## ⚡ What You'll Learn

Here's a quick overview of what this handbook covers:

### 🚀 Getting Started with AI Agents
- What exactly is an AI agent?
- Why do we need them?
- How do they work?
- What are the prerequisites?

### 🏗️ Architecture & Design Principles
- Types of agents: reactive, deliberative, learning
- Modular vs monolithic designs
- Real-world design patterns

### 🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs)
- What are LLMs and how they power agents
- Comparing top models: OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Ollama
- Choosing between cloud-based vs local LLMs

### ✍️ Prompt Engineering
- Writing effective prompts (basic to advanced)
- Techniques for output parsing and refinement
- Iterative prompting strategies

### 🧱 Frameworks
- Overview of agent frameworks: Langchain, CrewAI, Composio, Flowise
- When to use each
- Setup guides and real project examples

### ☁️ Deployment
- Docker
- Google Cloud Provider (GCP).
- Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### 📚 Resources
- Open-source repos
- Learning paths and videos
- Active communities to join

## 🧩 How This Handbook Is Structured

Each section is organized into folders based on topics like [architect/](./content/02_architect/01_overview.md), [promptS/](./content/04_prompts/1_overview.md), [llms/](./content/03_llms/0_overview.md), [frameworks/](./content/05_framework/overview.md), and [deployment/](./content/06_deployment/docker/),  [resources/](./content/07_resources/).

Inside each folder, you’ll find:
- Bite-sized markdown files focused on one subtopic
- Real-world examples when applicable
- Clear, no-fluff explanations to help you move fast

---

## ✅ Who Is This For?

This guide is perfect for:
- Beginners getting started with agents
- Builders who want working templates
- Hackers, freelancers, and developers
- Anyone who wants to explore agent-based systems without the overwhelm
