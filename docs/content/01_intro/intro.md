# AI Agent:

## What Are AI Agents?
AI Agents are autonomous systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that can:
- 🤖 Perform tasks without human intervention  
- 🔄 Remember context and learn from interactions  
- 🛠️ Use tools/APIs to take real-world actions  

### Agents aren’t magic—they’re just software on steroids!"
**🔄 Agent : Sense → Think → Act**

An AI agent is your digital Assistant that:

* Senses (reads inputs: text, APIs, cameras)
* Thinks (LLM brain + logic)
* Acts (clicks buttons, writes code, talks back!)

```python
# Basic Agent Pseudocode
while True:
    observation = sense_environment()  # 👀
    decision = llm_think(observation)  # 🧠
    take_action(decision)             # 🦾
```

### 📚 Agent Types
#### 2. ⚡ "Dumb but Fast" Reactive Agents
* Like: That friend who replies instantly but without context
* Good for: Simple rules ("If user says 'hi', reply 'hello'")
* Example: Customer support bots with fixed responses
```text
User: "My order is late!"  
Bot: "Sorry! Track your order here: [link]"  # No memory, no analysis
```
#### 2. 🧠 "Overthinker" Deliberative Agents
* Like: Your project manager who makes 10 backup plans
* Tricks: Uses memory, plans step-by-step
* Example: Travel agent that compares flights/hotels for you
```text
graph TD
    A[User: "Plan Goa trip"] --> B[Check flights]
    B --> C[Find hotels]
    C --> D[Suggest itinerary]
```
#### 3. 🎓 "Learn from Mistakes" Adaptive Agents
* Like: That intern who improves every week
* Secret Sauce: Learns from feedback (reinforcement learning)
* Example: Netflix recommending better shows as you watch

Pro Tip: These need training data

**Before building:**
- Python (Just basics—if/else, dicts)
- APIs (How to call/webhooks)
- LLM Basics (Prompts, tokens, costs)
