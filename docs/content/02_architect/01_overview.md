# 🏗️ Agent Architecture & Design Overview

Before diving in how ot build a smart AI agent, you need to understand its brain - that is , its architecture

Architecture defines **how your agent thinks, reacts, plans, and learns**. It shapes how the agent handles tasks, uses tools, interacts with users, and scales in complexity.

In this section, we’ll explore the most common agent design patterns and how to pick the right one for your use case.

## 🔍 Why Architecture Matters

- 🧠 A simple "if-this-then-that" agent is fast but dumb.
- 🧭 A planning agent may think before it acts.
- 🎯 A learning agent adapts and improves over time.

Choosing the right design helps you balance between:
- Speed vs intelligence
- Flexibility vs predictability
- Simplicity vs long-term scalability

## ⚙️ Types of Agent Architectures

Here's a quick summary of the main agent types:

### 1. **Reactive Agents**
- Respond instantly to input
- No memory, no planning
- Great for simple tasks (e.g., replying to emails)

### 2. **Deliberative Agents**
- Maintain an internal state
- Can plan actions before execution
- Use reasoning, goals, and decision-making

### 3. **Learning Agents**
- Improve over time based on feedback or reward
- Use techniques like RL (Reinforcement Learning)
- Useful for long-term automation and dynamic tasks
