# ⚡ Reactive Agents

Reactive agents are the simplest type of AI agents — they react to the environment instantly, without thinking, planning, or remembering.

Think of them like reflexes: you touch something hot, you pull your hand back. No planning, just action.

## 🧠 How They Work

- **No memory:** They don’t store past actions or state.
- **No planning:** They don’t evaluate multiple steps or outcomes.
- **Rule-based:** They follow a fixed set of condition-action rules.
- **Fast and lightweight:** Since there's no thinking involved, they’re very efficient.

>**Example**
> "If condition A is true, then do action B."

## 🔄 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a basic customer support chatbot:

> **User:** “What’s your refund policy?”  
> **Bot:** *Immediately replies with a pre-written answer from a FAQ database.*

That’s a reactive agent. It doesn’t ask follow-ups. It doesn’t remember you. It just reacts.

## ✅ Use Cases for Reactive Agents

Reactive agents are perfect when:
- The task is repetitive and predictable.
- The input and output are clearly defined.
- You want speed over complexity.

### Common Examples:
- Auto-reply email agents (Gmail smart responder)
- FAQ bots
- Notification systems
- One-shot classification agents (like spam filters)

## 🔧 Pros and Cons

| Pros                          | Cons                             |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ✅ Very fast                  | ❌ No memory or learning         |
| ✅ Easy to build              | ❌ Can't handle multi-step logic |
| ✅ Great for simple tasks     | ❌ Can't adapt over time         |
| ✅ Lightweight                | ❌ No personalization            |

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks to Use

Reactive agents can be built using:
- **Langchain** (with single-tool chains)
- **CrewAI** (simple task-tool pairing)
- **Composio** (for quick automation workflows)
- Basic Python scripts using `if-else`

## 🔁 Should You Use a Reactive Agent?

Use reactive agents when:
- You want fast results with minimal setup.
- The task doesn’t require deep context.
- You’re starting with a proof of concept.

Skip them if:
- You need long-term memory or planning.
- Your agent interacts across multiple steps or tools.
- You want learning or adaptability.

## 📌 Summary

Reactive agents are great for:
- Getting started quickly
- Building lightweight assistants
- Handling narrow, well-defined tasks

> They’re not “dumb” — they’re just focused. Use them where they shine.
