## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Python Setup (With LangChain)

LangChain now supports Gemini via `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`.

```python
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
 model="gemini-1.5-pro",
 temperature=0.3
)

response = llm.invoke("Give me a summary of this calendar event...")
print(response)
```

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
**Use Gemini with Composio or LangChain to connect to Google tools**

Reduce hallucination by giving clear instructions

Use prompt templates and examples in Google AI Studio

### üß© When to Choose Gemini Over OpenAI
**Use Gemini when:**
- Gmail/Drive integration. 
- Multimodal tasks (text + image). 
- Mobile or on-device agents	. 
- Reasoning-heavy workflow. 
- Large code generation.

### üìå Summary
Gemini is a strong alternative to OpenAI ‚Äî especially if you're already using Google tools or want better support for long inputs.

**For Gmail agents, calendar workflows, or document parsing ‚Äî Gemini just makes sense.**
