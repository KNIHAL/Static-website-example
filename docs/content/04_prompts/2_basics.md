# 📘 Basics Prompt Engineering

*It's just a simple and direct instructuion, no examples, no workflows. It's best for quicks tasks, General Knowledge.*

### Three Core Prompt Styles

### 1. **Zero-Shot**
Ask the model to do something without any examples.  
🧭 **When to use:** Simple tasks where the model likely has the knowledge.  
**Example:**  Translate to French: "Good morning."



### 2. **One-Shot**
Give one example first to guide the model.  
**Example:**  
Great for quick answers, but might miss the mark for complex tasks.
English: "Hello" → French: "Bonjour"

Translate to French: "See you soon" →

>Helps the model learn your style—just one example.

### 3. **Few-Shot**
Add a few examples to set the pattern.  
**Example:**  
Hello → Bonjour
Good night → Bonne nuit
Thank you → Merci

Translate: "How are you?" →
>Improves accuracy for structured or tricky tasks

## 4. Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT)
Prompt the model to think step-by-step, great for logic or math.   
**Example:**
Q: What’s 37 + 48?
A: Let's think step by step.
…

## Why These Matter

- **Zero-shot** is fast and cheap.
- **Few-shot** gives structure and better results. 
- **CoT** adds clear reasoning for multi-step problems.

| Style      | Example Prompt                                                            |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero‑Shot | `Classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral: "It was fun."`  |
| One‑Shot  | Provide one example, then ask:  
| Few‑Shot  | Give 3 examples, then ask your question.                                 |
| CoT       | `Q: How many apples left? A: Let's think step by step...`                |

## Pro Tips for Better Prompts

- **Be clear & specific** – Avoid vague prompts.
- **Keep it concise** – Trim fluff but stay clear.  
- **Give examples** – Especially if you want structured output. 
- **Encourage reasoning** – Use “please think step by step.”

##  ✅ Summary

1. **Start simple** with zero-shot.  
2. **Add examples** for structure (one‑shot or few‑shot).  
3. **Use CoT** when logic or step-wise thinking matters.  
4. **Iterate** until it hits the mark.

Master these basics and your AI agent will be ahead of the game.
