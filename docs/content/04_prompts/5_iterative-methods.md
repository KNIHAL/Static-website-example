# Iterative Prompting – Fix, Tweak, Repeat 🔁

Sometimes your first prompt just... doesn’t hit right. That’s normal. Iterative prompting is all about testing, adjusting, and improving until your AI gives the response *you actually want*. Think of it like debugging—but for your words.

Let’s break it down in a chill, no-fluff way.

## 💡 Why Bother With Iteration?

Because AI isn’t perfect.

Even if your model is smart, it can:
- Miss details
- Add fluff
- Get confused
- Output wrong formats

Instead of rewriting your whole system, just tweak the prompt a little. Small edits can make a **huge** difference.

## 🔁 The Basic Loop

Here’s the simple flow we follow:

1. 📝 Write a basic prompt  
2. 👀 Look at what the model gives you  
3. 🔍 Spot what's off (missing info? wrong format?)  
4. 🛠️ Tweak your prompt — add examples, change instructions  
5. 🔁 Run it again  
6. ✅ Lock the best version when you’re happy

It’s fast. It’s simple. It works.

## 🧵 Real-Life Mini Example

**Goal:** Summarize an email

**First Try Prompt:**
Summarize this email.

**AI Output:**  
“The sender wrote about multiple things.”

😐 Umm... thanks?

---

**Second Try Prompt:**
Summarize this email in 3 bullet points, less than 20 words each.

**AI Output:**
- Payment confirmed  
- Delivery expected next week  
- Customer support issued an apology  

✅ Clean. Focused. Ready to use.

## 🔄 Use the AI to Improve Itself

Cool trick: Ask the model to self-correct.
Now make your answer more structured and remove any unnecessary words

Or even:Was your last answer too long or vague? If yes, rewrite it better.

The model becomes its own QA reviewer. 🤯

## 🤖 Automate This Inside Your Agent

If you're building agents, let them retry when:
- Output is in the wrong format
- Required info is missing
- JSON breaks your parser
- Confidence is low

Here’s a quick example in Python using LangChain:

```python
from langchain.output_parsers import RetryOutputParser

parser = RetryOutputParser.from_llm(
    parser=JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object=MySchema),
    llm=my_model,
    max_retries=3
)
```
One line of defense? Not enough. Two? Much better.

### 🔧 Cool Iteration Techniques
| Trick           | What It Does                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Prompt Layering | Add info in steps (e.g. summary → format)  |
| Self-Critique   | Ask model to review its own answer         |
| Output Scoring  | Generate 3 answers, pick the best          |
| Retry on Fail   | Automatically retry if the format is wrong |
| Chain Feedback  | One model reviews another’s output 😎      |


### ⚡ Summary
- Your first prompt won’t be perfect. That’s fine.
- Use small tweaks: clearer words, better examples, added constraints
- Ask AI to self-review (yes, it works!)
- Automate retries when building agents
- Think of it like tuning—not reinventing
