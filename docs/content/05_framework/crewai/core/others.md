# 🧠 Reasoning, Planning, Training, Testing, CLI, LLMs & Process

This section combines several critical aspects of CrewAI development. Whether you're building a basic prototype or deploying a complex agent system, these concepts will show up often. Let's break them down and keep things simple but effective.

---

## 🧩 Reasoning

Reasoning is what makes agents seem *smart*. It’s how they decide what to do next.

CrewAI doesn't implement complex logic engines, but you can:

* Break tasks into atomic steps
* Chain LLM outputs across tasks
* Create tool-augmented decisions (e.g., using Python tools to calculate before replying)

**Example**:

```python
class MathCrew(Crew):
    def think_and_solve(self, question):
        if "add" in question:
            return self.tools.calculator.add(...)
        elif "multiply" in question:
            return self.tools.calculator.multiply(...)
```

Or let the LLM decide dynamically with prompts like:

```text
"You are a logical assistant. First, explain your reasoning, then answer."
```

## 🗺 Planning

Planning is about sequencing tasks **before** execution. CrewAI allows a lightweight form of planning using task flows or agents with scoped goals.

### Manual Planning:

Define tasks in order.

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: 1
    description: "Collect product data"
  - id: 2
    description: "Summarize trends"
  - id: 3
    description: "Write report"
```

### Agent Planning:

Use agent memory/goals to let it figure things out dynamically.

```python
agent.goal = "Analyze all user feedback and report top 5 pain points."
```

🧠 *Pro tip*: Planning logic can be abstracted as tools or run inside flows.

## 🏋️ Training (Sort of)

CrewAI doesn't involve model-level training (like fine-tuning). But you *can* optimize performance by:

* Iterating on prompt templates
* Using few-shot examples in tasks
* Customizing instructions per agent

> Think of it as "prompt training" not "model training"

You can also simulate conversations to test prompt effectiveness.

## 🧪 Testing

Don't ignore testing—even for LLM agents!

### Manual testing

Run the crew via Python or CLI and inspect output.

### Programmatic testing

```python
def test_summary_output():
    result = my_crew.run_task("Summarize this: ...")
    assert "key points" in result.lower()
```

You can mock tools, assert outputs, and even log LLM calls.

---

## 🔧 CLI Usage

CrewAI comes with a simple CLI to run your crews and flows.

```bash
crewai run agent.yaml
crewai run crew.py
```

You can also pass arguments, set env variables, or use `.env` files to configure credentials and settings.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
crewai run my_crew.py
```

## 🧠 LLM Settings

Choose the right LLM depending on the task:

| Task Type       | Suggested Model        |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Basic QA        | gpt-3.5-turbo          |
| Summarization   | gpt-4, claude-3-sonnet |
| Code generation | gpt-4o, code-llama     |
| Fast iterations | gpt-4o-mini            |

Set this in your crew, flow, or task:

```python
crew.model = "gpt-4o"
```

Or in YAML:

```yaml
model: gpt-4o-mini
```

## 🧵 Agent Execution Process

This is the mental model of how things run:

1. **Define** roles and goals for each agent
2. **Write** clear tasks and assign agents
3. **Connect** tools and memory if needed
4. **Run** your crew (CLI or Python)
5. **Monitor** results, update prompts, repeat

### ✅ Summary

* **Reasoning** helps simulate intelligence
* **Planning** helps avoid chaos
* **Training** = prompt + example crafting
* **Testing** validates your logic
* **CLI** runs things simply
* **LLMs** should be chosen wisely
* **Process** matters—define, test, improve

You're now equipped with the mental models to go beyond just building agents—you're engineering intelligence. Let’s keep building!
