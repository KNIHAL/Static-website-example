# Docker Overview

**Docker** is a containerization platform that helps you run your apps in isolated environments. In AI Agent development, Docker simplifies deployment and makes your environments consistent ‚Äî whether you're running locally or on the cloud.

This section will help you understand:
- Why Docker is important for AI agent systems
- How Docker fits into Flowise and other frameworks
- Basic Docker terms you should know before jumping in

## üß† Why Use Docker in AI Agent Development?

- **Consistency**: No more ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù issues.
- **Portability**: Package your agent as a Docker image and deploy it anywhere (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
- **Scaling**: Use Docker with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to scale your AI agents.
- **Rapid Testing**: Spin up new test environments in seconds.
